# Transistor notes

transistors are devices made out of semiconductors. their purpose is to either amplify an electric signal or act as an on off switch.
they are usually made out of 3 regions (a doped semiconductor chip either p or n type which basically means electrons removed or added).
n-type transistors are electron rich and p type are hole rich (electron poor).
when used for switching usually a small current at their base opens a pathway for electric signals to flow through them to turn on/off.
when used for amplification it's similar, a weak signal modulates a much larger one.
